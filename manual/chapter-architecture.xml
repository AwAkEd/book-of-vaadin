            Vaadin provides two development models for web applications: for the
            client-side (the browser) and for the server-side. The server-driven
            development model is the more powerful one, allowing application development
            solely on the server-side, by utilizing an AJAX-based Vaadin Client-Side
            Engine that renders the user interface in the browser. The client-side model
            allows developing widgets and applications in Java, which are compiled to
            JavaScript and executed in the browser. The two models can share their UI
            widgets, themes, and back-end code and services, and can be mixed together
            easily.

			A server-side Vaadin application runs as a servlet in a Java web server,
			serving HTTP requests. The <classname>VaadinServlet</classname> is normally
			used as the servlet class. The servlet receives client requests and inteprets
			them as events for a particular user session. Events are associated with user
			interface components and delivered to the event listeners defined in the
			application. If the UI logic makes changes to the server-side user interface
			components, the servlet renders them in the web browser by generating a
			response. The client-side engine running in the browser receives the responses
			and uses them to make any necessary changes to the page in the browser.

                    <para>
                        Vaadin applications provide a user interface for the user to
                        interface with the business logic and data of the application. At
                        technical level, the UI is realized as a
                        <emphasis>&root;</emphasis> class that extends
                        <classname>com.vaadin.ui.&rootclass;</classname>. Its main task is
                        to create the initial user interface out of UI components and set
                        up event listeners to handle user input. The &root; can then be
                        loaded in the browser using an URL, or can be embedded to any HTML
                        page. For detailed information about implementing a
                        <classname>&rootclass;</classname>, see <xref

						The user interface of a Vaadin application consists of components

						component has a client-side counterpart, a
						"<emphasis>widget</emphasis>", by which it is rendered in the
						browser and with which the user interacts. The client-side widgets
						can also be used by client-side applications. The server-side
						components relay these events to the application logic. Field
						components that have a value, which the user can view or edit, can
						be bound to a data source (see below). For a more detailed
						description of the UI component architecture, see <xref

                        Server-side Vaadin applications work on top of the Java Servlet
                        API. The Vaadin servlet, or more exactly the
                        <classname>VaadinServlet</classname> class, receives requests from
                        different clients, determines which user session they belong to by
                        tracking the sessions with cookies, and delegates the requests to
                        their corresponding sessions. You can customize the Vaadin
                        servlet by extending it.

						Vaadin makes a separation between the appearance and component
						structure of the user interface. While the UI logic is handled as
						Java code, the presentation is defined in
						<emphasis>themes</emphasis> as CSS or SCSS. Vaadin provides a
						number of default themes. User themes can, in addition to style
						sheets, include HTML templates that define custom layouts and

						Interaction with user interfafce components creates events, which

						In addition to the user interface model, Vaadin provides a
						<emphasis>data model</emphasis> for binding data presented in
						field components, such as text fields, check boxes and selection
						components, to a data source. Using the data model, the user
						interface components can update the application data directly,
						often without the need for any control code. All the field
						components in Vaadin use this data model internally, but any of
						them can be bound to a separate data source as well.

                        In addition to server-side web applications, Vaadin supports

                        Client-side modules can use the same widgets, themes, and back-end
                        services as server-side Vaadin applications. They are useful when
                        you have a need for highly responsive UI logic, such as for games
                        or for serving a large number of clients with possibly stateless
                        server-side code, and for various other purposes, such as offering
                        an off-line mode for server-side applications. Please see <xref

					<para>
                        Vaadin is meant for building user interfaces, and it is
                        recommended that other application layers should be kept separate
                        from the UI. The business logic can run in the same servlet as the
                        UI code, usually separated at least by a Java API, possibly as
                        EJBs, or distributed to a remote back-end service. The data
                        storage is usually distributed to a database management system,
                        and is typically accessed through a persistence solution, such as
                        JPA.

				AJAX, short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a technique for
				developing web applications with responsive user interaction, similar to
				traditional desktop applications. While conventional JavaScript-enabled
				HTML pages can receive new content only by loading an entire new page,
				AJAX-enabled pages send user interaction to the server using an
				asynchronous request and receive updated content in the response. This
				way, only small parts of the page data need to be loaded.

                This goal is archieved by the use of a certain set of technologies: XHTML,
                CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and the XMLHttpRequest API in JavaScript. XML is
                just one way to serialize data between the client and the server, and in
                Vaadin it is serialized with the more efficient JSON.
			</para>

			<para>
				AJAX is essentially made possible by a simple API, namely the
				<methodname>XMLHttpRequest</methodname> class in JavaScript. The API is
				available in all major browsers and, as of 2006, the API is under way to
				become a W3C standard.
			</para>

			<para>
				Communications between the browser and the server usually require some

				handles serialization of shared state between server and client, as well

                The Vaadin client-side framework is based on the Google Web Toolkit (GWT),
                which purpose is to enable the development of client-side web applications
                easily with Java, without having to use JavaScript or other browser
                technologies directly. Pure client-side Vaadin applications are developed
                with Java and compiled into JavaScript with the Vaadin Compiler, which is
                an extension of the GWT Compiler.
			</para>

			<para>
				GWT is essentially a client-side technology, normally used to develop user
				interface logic in the web browser. Pure GWT applications still need to
				communicate with a server using RPC calls and by serializing any data. The
				server-driven development mode in Vaadin effectively hides all the
				client-server communications and allows handling user interaction logic in
				a server-side application. This makes the architecture of an AJAX-based
				web application much simpler.
			</para>

			<para>
				Vaadin uses GWT to render user interfaces in the web browser and
				handle the low-level tasks of user interaction in the browser. Use of GWT is
				largely invisible in Vaadin for applications that do not need any

            The user interface of a server-side Vaadin application is rendered in the
            browser by the Vaadin Client-Side Engine. It is loaded in the browser when the
            page with the Vaadin UI is opened. The server-side UI components are rendered
            using <emphasis>widgets</emphasis> (as they are called in Google Web Toolkit)
            on the client-side. The client-side engine illustrated in <xref

        <para>
            The client-side framework includes two kinds of built-in widgets: GWT widgets
            and Vaadin-specific widgets. The two widget collections have significant
            overlap, where the Vaadin widgets provide a bit different features than the
            GWT widgets. In addition, many add-on widgets and their server-side
            counterparts exists, and you can easily download and install them, as
            described in <xref linkend="addons"/>. You can also develop your own widgets,

        <para>
            The rendering as well as the communication to the server-side is handled in

	<section xml:id="architecture.events">
		<title>Events and Listeners</title>

		<para>
            Vaadin offers an event-driven programming model for handling user interaction.
            When a user does something in the user interface, such as clicks a button or
            selects an item, the application needs to know about it. Many Java-based user
            interface frameworks follow the <emphasis>Event-Listener pattern</emphasis>
            (also known as the Observer design pattern) to communicate user input to the
            application logic.  So does Vaadin. The design pattern involves two kinds of
            elements: an object that generates ("fires" or "emits") events and a number of
            listeners that listen for the events. When such an event occurs, the object
            sends a notification about it to all the listeners. In a typical case, there
            is only one listener.
		</para>

		<para>
            Events can serve many kinds of purposes. In Vaadin, the usual purpose of
            events is handling user interaction in a user interface. Session management
            can require special events, such as for time-out, in which case the event
            would actually be the lack of user interaction. Time-out is a special case of
            timed or scheduled events, where an event occurs at a specific date and time
            or when a set time has passed.
		</para>

		<para>
            To receive events of a particular type, an application must register a
            listener object with the event source. The listeners are registered in the
            components with an <methodname>add*Listener()</methodname> method (with a
            method name specific to the listener).
		</para>

		<para>
			Most components that have related events define their own event class and the
			corresponding listener class. For example, the <classname>Button</classname>
			has <classname>Button.ClickEvent</classname> events, which can be listened to
			through the <classname>Button.ClickListener</classname> interface.
        </para>

        <para>
            In the following, we handle button clicks with a listener implemented as an
            anonymous class:
        </para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[final Button button = new Button("Push it!");

button.addClickListener(new Button.ClickListener() {
    public void buttonClick(ClickEvent event) {
        button.setCaption("You pushed it!");
    }
});]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			<xref linkend="figure.eventlistenerdiagram"/> illustrates the case where an
			application-specific class inherits the
			<classname>Button.ClickListener</classname> interface to be able to listen for
			button click events. The application must instantiate the listener class and
			register it with <methodname>addClickListener()</methodname>. When an event
			occurs, an event object is instantiated, in this case a
			<classname>Button.ClickEvent</classname>. The event object knows the related
			UI component, in this case the <classname>Button</classname>.

		<para>
			In the ancient times of C programming, <emphasis>callback functions</emphasis>
			filled largely the same need as listeners do now. In object-oriented
			languages, we have only classes and methods, not functions, so the application
			has to give a class interface instead of a callback function pointer to the
			framework. However, Vaadin supports defining a method as a listener as well,
			using the <classname>MethodListener</classname> wrapper.
		</para>

		<para>
			Notice that many listener interfaces inherit the
			<classname>java.util.EventListener</classname> superinterface, but it
			is not generally necessary to inherit it.
