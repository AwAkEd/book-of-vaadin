    <para>
        Vaadin Timeline is an add-on component that gives the user an intuitive
        understanding of events and trends. A timeline consists of a time-axis
        depicting a desired time range and some events or values mapped to the time
        range.

    <para>
        A timeline allows representing time-related data visually as graphs instead of
        numerical values. They are used commonly in almost all fields of business,
        science, and technology, such as in project management to map out milestones and
        goals, in geology to map out historical events, and perhaps most prominently in
        the stock market.
    </para>

    <para>
        With Vaadin Timeline, you can represent almost any time-related statistical data
        that has a time-value mapping. Even several data sources can be used for
        comparison between data. This allows the user to better grasp of changes in the
        data and antipate forthcoming trends and problems.
    </para>

    <para>
        Vaadin Timeline can be easily included in a Vaadin application and is highly
        customizable to suit almost any purpose. Timeline supports multiple graph types as
        well as events and markers. The user interaction with the Timeline is
        straight-forward and simple.

        Book of Vaadin currently includes only an introduction to Vaadin Timeline. Please

        further details.

        <para>
            If you have several graphs in the timeline, you can also stack them on top
            of each other instead of drawing them on top of each other by setting
            <methodname>setGraphStacking()</methodname> in
            <classname>Timeline</classname> to <literal>true</literal>.

        <title>Interaction Elements</title>

        <para>
            The user can interact with the Vaadin Timeline in several ways.
        </para>

        <para>
            On the bottom of the timeline there is a <emphasis>scrollbar area</emphasis>
            where you can move the time forward or backward in time by dragging the time
            range box or by clicking the left and right arrow buttons. You can change the
            time range by resizing the range box in the scrollbar area. You can also zoom
            with the mouse wheel when the pointer is inside the component.
        </para>

        <para>
            The middle area of the timeline is the <emphasis>main area</emphasis> where
            the selected time range is displayed. Time scale is shown below the main
            area. The time scale used depends on the zoom level and can be a time unit
            from hours to years. Value scale is displayed on the right side of the main
            area. The scale can be either a static value range or a range calculated from
            the displayed data set. The user can move in time by dragging the main area
            with the mouse left and right and zoom in and out by using the mouse wheel.

        <para>
            You can select a <emphasis>preset zoom level</emphasis> with the buttons on
            the top the Timeline. This will change the displayed time range to match the
            zoom level. The zoom levels are fully customizable to suit the time range in
            the API.

        <para>
            The <emphasis>current time range</emphasis> is shown at the top-right corner
            of the component. Clicking the dates makes them editable, so that you can
            manually change them. <emphasis>Graph legend</emphasis> is shown below the
            time range. The legend explains what is represented by each bar on the graph
            and displays the current value when the user moves the mouse cursor over the
            graph.

            Finally, the available <emphasis>chart modes</emphasis> are shown below the

        <para>
            You can use or hide any of the features above can be shown or hidden depending
            on your needs. For example, if you only need to display a graph without any
            controls, you can hide all them from the API.

    <section xml:id="addons.timeline.intro.events">
        <title>Event Markers</title>
        
        <para>
            In addition to graphs, the timeline can have events. An event can be, for
            example, the time of a published advertisement in a graph that displays
            website hits. Combining the event data with the graphs enables the user to
            observe the relevance of the advertisement to the website hits visually.
        </para>

        <para>
            Vaadin Timeline provides two types of event markers, as illustrated in <xref

        <title>Efficiency</title>

        <para>
            Vaadin Timeline reduces the traffic between the server and the client by using
            two methods.
        </para>

        <para>
            First of all, all the data that is presented in the component is dynamically
            fetched from the server as needed. This means that when the user scrolls the
            timeline view, the component continuously fetches data from the server. Also,
            only data that is visible to the user is transferred to the client. For
            example, if the timeline has data that has been measured once a second for an
            entire year, not all the data will be sent to the client. Only the data which
            can be rendered on the screen without overlapping is sent. This ensures that,
            even for large data sets, the loading time is small and only the necessary
            data is actually transferred over the network.
        </para>

        <para>
            Second, Vaadin Timeline caches the data received from the server in the
            browser, so that the data is transferred over the network only once, if
            possible. This speeds up the time-range browsing when data can be fetched from
            the cache instead of reloading it over the network.
