	<title>Testing and Debugging on Mobile Devices</title>

    <para>
        Testing places special challenges for mobile devices. The mobile browsers may not
        have much debugging features and you may not be able to install third-party
        browser add-ons, such as Firebug.

            The debug mode, as described in <xref linkend="advanced.debug-production-modes"/>,
            works on mobile browsers as well, even if it is a bit harder to use.

            The lack of FireBug and similar tools can be helped with simple client-side
            coding. For example, you can dump the HTML content of the page easily with the
            <parameter>innerHTML</parameter> property in the HTML DOM.

            TouchKit supports especially WebKit-based browsers, which are used in iOS and
            Android devices. You can therefore reach a good compatibility using a desktop
            browser based on WebKit. Features such as geolocation are also supported by modern
            desktop browsers. If you make your phone/tablet-detection and orientation
            detection using screen size, you can easily emulate the modes by resizing the
            browser features. Many of the desktop browsers also have advanced debugging
            features and allow installing debugging add-ons.
