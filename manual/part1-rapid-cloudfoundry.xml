    <title>Deploying to Cloud Foundry</title>

    <para>
        Cloud Foundry (<literal>http://cloudfoundry.com/</literal>) is a new
        platform-as-a-service solution from SpringSource. Cloud Foundry makes it extremely
        easy to deploy applications created with Spring Roo and Vaadin to the cloud.

    <para>
        Before you can deploy to Cloud Foundry, you must register an account at
        <literal>http://cloudfoundry.com/</literal>. The activation might take some time,
        so you should do this several days before you need it.

            Once the new server is installed, you can add your project to it, just like
            you would add your project to any other server using the
            <guilabel>Servers</guilabel> view. Once added, right-click on the project and
            choose <guibutton>Start</guibutton>. This will ask for a name that identifies
            your project in the cloud as well as the URL to deploy to. After giving this
            information, the project will be uploaded and started in the cloud. After a
            few seconds, you should be able to visit the URL you provided and see your
            project in action.
