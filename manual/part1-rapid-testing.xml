    OUTLINE
    
    Explain that we'll cover only integration testing here as it is more vaadin specific. Testbech is used.
    
    add failsafe plugin to enable integration tests. It will run automatically tests named like **ITCase.java 

configure jetty run before integration tests are run and stop afterwards (failsafe manual)

Create a very simple smoketest to verify the applicaiton deploys properly and vaadin kickstart page is returned. At the same time we verify that integration test system works properly.

testbench

install test bench. Vaadin testbench is not available in maven repository, install jar into local repository with command:
mvn install::install-file -Dfile=vaadin-testbench-2.2.1.jar -DgroupId=com.vaadin -DartifactId=testbench -Dversion=2.2.1 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true


Next add testbech as a dependency to your test "scope". We will need it when compiling test scripts from html to JUnit test cases and also when executing the actual junit tests.

Use maven exec plugin to compile testbench files (.html) to JUnit for running. To help this a DecentTestConverter helper class is needed.

Add generated sources to test sources.

configure failsafe plugin for integration tests.  These are needed for test bench originated junit tests:com.vaadin.testbench.tester.host, com.vaadin.testbench.deployment.url, com.vaadin.testbench.screenshot.directory. 

If no separate test cluster is used, one could simplify testing so that test hub/rc is started and stopped similar to jetty.</para>
