Book of Vaadin
Vaadin 6 Preview Edition

The Book of Vaadin gives you an overview of web application development with Vaadin and
covers all the major features and components with clear explanations and code
examples.

Vaadin is a unique server-driven web application framework that allows you to develop
applications on the server-side in Java. If you need new components, you can continue with
Java on the client-side with Google Web Toolkit. It runs in the browser with no need for
plugins.

Among other things, the book provides:

  * An introduction to application development with Vaadin
  * Practical instructions for creating your application project
  * Running and debugging applications under the Eclipse IDE and Firebug
  * Reference documentation of the UI components
  * Binding UI components directly to data
  * Making your applications look great with CSS themes
  * Google Web Toolkit widget development and integration

The book is available for free download from the <EMPHASIZE>vaadin.com</EMPHASIZE>
website, and is also included in the Vaadin installation package. The book is open source,
just like the rest of Vaadin.
