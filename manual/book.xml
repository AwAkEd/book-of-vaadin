				Vaadin enables developers to build high quality browser user interfaces
				with Java on the server. It provides a library of ready to use
				high-quality user interface components and defines a clean framework for
				creating your own components. The focus is on ease of use, re-usability,
				extensibility and meeting the requirements of large enterprise
				applications. Vaadin has been used in production since 2001 and it has
				proven to be suitable for building demanding business applications.

			<title>About This Book</title>

			<para>
				This book is intended for software developers who use Vaadin
				to develop web applications.
			</para>

			<section>
				<title>Prerequisites</title>

				<para>
					This book assumes that you have some experience with programming
					in Java. If not, Java is easy to learn if you have experience
					with other object oriented languages, such as C++. You may have
					used some desktop-oriented user interface toolkits for Java, such
					as AWT, Swing, or SWT. Or for C++, a toolkit such as Qt. Such knowledge is
					useful for understanding the scope of Vaadin, but not
					necessary. Regarding the web, it is good if you know the basics of
					HTML and CSS, so that you can develop basic presentation themes
					for the application. Knowledge of Google Web Toolkit (GWT), JavaScript, and AJAX is
					needed only if you develop special custom UI components.
				</para>
			</section>

			<section>
				<title>Organization of This Book</title>
				
				<para>
					The Vaadin Reference Manual is divided into two parts:
					Developer's Guide and API Reference.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The Developer's guide first gives an introduction to what
					<productname>Vaadin</productname> is and how you use it
					to develop web applications. It then proceeds to architecture,
					particular components and features of Vaadin, to special
					topics, and finally to special design patterns for Vaadin.
				</para>

				<para>
					API Reference gives the full documentation for particular classes
					and interfaces, and their methods. The API documentation is also
					available in JavaDoc format, as a HTML page with frames.
				</para>

				<section>
					<title>Demo Applications</title>
					
					<para>
						The installation package of Vaadin includes a few demo
						applications that you can easily run and use with a web
						browser. You can view the source code of the individual demo
						applications from the main menu. The demo applications include
						Sampler, which offers demonstrations (samples) of most user
						interface components in Vaadin, provides source code for the
						samples, and offers some best-practice advice.
					</para>
					
					<para>
						You can also find the demo application online at <link
