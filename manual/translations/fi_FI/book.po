"Vaadin is a server-side AJAX web application development framework that "
"enables developers to build high-quality user interfaces with Java. It "
"provides a library of ready-to-use user interface components and a clean "
"framework for creating your own components. The focus is on ease-of-use, re-"
"usability, extensibility, and meeting the requirements of large enterprise "
"applications. Vaadin has been used in production since 2001 and it has "
"proven to be suitable for building demanding business applications."
