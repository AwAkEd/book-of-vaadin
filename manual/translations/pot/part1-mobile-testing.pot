msgid "TouchKit supports especially WebKit-based browsers, which are used in iOS and Android devices. You can therefore reach a good compatibility by using a desktop browser based on WebKit. Features such as geolocation are also supported by desktop browsers. If you make your phone/tablet-detection and orientation detection using screen size, you can easily emulate the modes by resizing the browser."
