msgid "User Interface Definition Language (UIDL) is a language for serializing user interface contents and changes in responses from web server to a browser. The idea is that the server-side components \"paint\" themselves to the screen (a web page) with the language. The UIDL messages are parsed in the browser and translated to GWT widgets."
msgstr ""

#: part1-uidl.xml:14(para) 
msgid "The UIDL is used through both server-side and client-side APIs. The server-side API consists of the <classname>PaintTarget</classname> interface, described in <xref linkend=\"uidl.painting\"/>. The client-side interface depends on the implementation of the client-side engine. In Vaadin Release 5, the client-side engine uses the Google Web Toolkit framework. Painting the user interface with a GWT widget is described in <xref linkend=\"gwt.widgets\"/>."

msgid "Since Vaadin Release 5, the UIDL communications are currently done using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is a lightweight data interchange format that is especially efficient for interfacing with JavaScript-based AJAX code in the browser. The use of JSON as the interchange format is largely transparent; IT Mill Toolkit version 4 (predecessor of Vaadin released in 2006) the older versions used an XML-based UIDL representation with the same API. Nevertheless, the UIDL API uses XML concepts such as attributes and elements. Below, we show examples of a <classname>Button</classname> component in both XML and JSON notation."
