msgid "First of all, all the data that is presented in the component is dynamically fetched from the server as needed. This means that when the user scrolls the timeline view, the component continuously fetches data from the server. Also, only data that is visible to the user is transferred to the client. For example, if the timeline has data that has been measured once a second for an entire year, not all the data will be sent to the client. Only the data which can be rendered on the screen without overlapping is sent. This ensures that, even for large data sets, the loading time is small and only the necessary data is actually transferred over the network."

msgid "Second, Vaadin Timeline caches the data received from the server in the browser, so that the data is transferred over the network only once, if possible. This speeds up the time-range browsing when data can be fetched from the cache instead of reloading it over the network."
