"Vaadin is a server-side AJAX web application development framework that "
"enables developers to build high-quality user interfaces with Java. It "
"provides a library of ready-to-use user interface components and a clean "
"framework for creating your own components. The focus is on ease-of-use, re-"
"usability, extensibility, and meeting the requirements of large enterprise "
"applications. Vaadin has been used in production since 2001 and it has "
"proven to be suitable for building demanding business applications."

"installation package and if you install the Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse, you "
"can browse it in the Eclipse Help. You may find the HTML or the Eclipse Help "
"plugin version more easily searchable than this printed book or the PDF "
"version, but the content is the same. Just like the rest of Vaadin, this "

"Writing this manual is ongoing work and this first edition represents a "
"snapshot around the release of Vaadin 6.1. A preview edition of this book "
"was published in May 2009, just before the first release of Vaadin 6. This "
"edition contains a large number of additions and corrections related to "
"Vaadin 6. While much of the book has been reviewed by the development team, "
"it is possible if not probable that errors and outdated sections still "
"remain. Many sections are under work and will be expanded in future."
