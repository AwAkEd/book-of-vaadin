            Computing is becoming ever increasingly mobile and web applications need to
            satisfy users with both computers and mobile devices, such as phones and
            tablets. While the mobile browsers can show the pages just like in regular
            browsers, the screen size, finger accuracy, and mobile browser features need
            to be considered to make the experience more pleasant. Vaadin TouchKit gives
            the power of Vaadin to mobile user interfaces that complement the regular web
            user interfaces of your web applications. Just like the purpose of the Vaadin
            Framework is to make desktop-like web applications, the purpose of TouchKit is
            to allow creation of web applications that give the look and feel of native
            mobile applications.

            In this chapter, we first look into the special considerations of mobile
            browsing. Then, we look how to create a project that uses TouchKit. TouchKit
            offers a number of special mobile components, which are described in a
            dedicated section. We treat phone and tablet applications separately, and
            discuss testing briefly. Finally, we discuss the limitations of TouchKit
            briefly. In the chapter, we use a Mobile Mail application as an example for
            creating a web application that looks very much like a native mobile
            application.

            Vaadin TouchKit is a commercial product licensed under a dual-licensing
            scheme. The AGPL license allows open-source development, while the CVAL
            license needs to be purchased for closed-source use, including internal use.
